                        <p>
                            Rhythmitica is the very first world online music academy that was founded by Hooman Tootoonchian and Parinaz Pourrezaei and established in 2012 based in Toronto, Canada.

                        <h3>Our Story</h3>
                        <p>
                        We believe that producing and educating art and ideas are among the noblest jobs in the world. Academic education of world music and promoting its art has been our goal from the beginning and we aspire to keep our endeavours towards this goal. Through the years, many have contacted us and have stated that they cannot find a professional instructor for world music in their respective location. Even if they had been able to find a teacher, the quality and the authenticity of the teachings have been a constant concern. This conceived the idea to form and establish Rhythmitica online music academy. First, we collected a powerful team of educators and experienced teachers and performers. Then, with the help of an experienced team of web producers, we made an exclusive platform for the educational content. Just like that, Rhythmitica has become a bridge to connect our excellent teachers with the students across the world.
